		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>Towards the end of 2019, the monetization team at Quora focused on exploring what a new stream of revenue outside of ads might look like. We decided to pursue <strong>a paid subscription to a suite of business oriented tools that would allow businesses to grow by leveraging their presence on Quora</strong>
		</p>
		<h4>Promotional content on Quora</h4>
		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>Businesses like <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Jason-M.-Lemkin" target="_">SaaStr</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Gabriel-Weinberg" target="_">DuckDuckGo</a> have found enormous success growing their businesses by having their CEOs write expert answers to questions in their domain expertiseâ€” proving Quora's Q&amp;A format and distribution network as a valuable channel to reach valuable customers and raise brand awareness.</p>
		<div class="main_body promotional-content">

				<div class="description">
					<h5>Helpful &amp; Friendly</h5>
					<p>The menu is expanded by default when you launch the app, directing your attention to the starting point. Each feature is accompanied by a description, making it friendly even for those who have never used online financial services before.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		<div class="partner">

			<div class="description">
				<h5>Partner Friendly</h5>
				<p>Menu options can receive special treatments based on partner needs. For example, a discount promotion will have a visually salient badge, and premium features can have inline CTAs for account upgrades.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
		<p>However, we also saw mounting discontent from our readers who are starting to distrust Quora because they feel deceived by promotional answers </p>
		<p><strong>How might we amplify Quora's distribution network's value for businesses without degrading the reading experience for our readers?</strong></p>
		<img src="/img/fb_2.png" />
		<p class="caption">Existing Menu</p>
		<p>The current menu is limited in a few ways:</p>
		<p>1. The features listed in the menu seem independent and disconnected, and thereâ€™s no logical to how they are ordered</p>
		<p>2. It's hard to distinguish between features at a glance due to lack of visuals</p>
		<p>3. Thereâ€™s  little user education on what each feature does</p>
		<p>4. The menu is not scalable to more than 5 items</p>
		<p><strong>We can create a custom menu to alleviate these problems and establish a clear mental model for users to access and discover features.</strong></p>
