		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>Towards the end of 2019, the monetization team at Quora focused on exploring what a new stream of revenue outside of ads might look like. We decided to pursue <strong>a paid subscription to a suite of business oriented tools that would allow businesses to grow by leveraging their presence on Quora</strong>
		</p>
		<h4>Promotional content on Quora</h4>
		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>Businesses like <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Jason-M.-Lemkin" target="_">SaaStr</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Gabriel-Weinberg" target="_">DuckDuckGo</a> have found enormous success growing their businesses by having their CEOs write expert answers to questions in their domain expertise— proving Quora's Q&amp;A format and distribution network as a valuable channel to reach valuable customers and raise brand awareness.</p>
</div>

		<p>However, we also saw mounting discontent from our readers who are starting to distrust Quora because they feel deceived by promotional answers </p>
		<p><strong>How might we amplify Quora's distribution network's value for businesses without degrading the reading experience for our readers?</strong></p>
