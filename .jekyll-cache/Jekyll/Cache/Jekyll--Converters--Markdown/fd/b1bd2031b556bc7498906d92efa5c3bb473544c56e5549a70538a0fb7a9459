		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>Towards the end of 2019, the monetization team at Quora focused on exploring what a new stream of revenue outside of ads might look like. We decided to pursue <strong>a paid subscription to a suite of business oriented tools that would allow businesses to grow by leveraging their presence on Quora</strong>
		</p>
		<h4>Writing for Your Businesss</h4>
		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>Businesses like <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Jason-M.-Lemkin" target="_">SaaStr</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Gabriel-Weinberg" target="_">DuckDuckGo</a> have found enormous success growing their businesses by having their CEOs write expert answers to questions in their domain expertise— proving Quora's Q&amp;A format and distribution network as a valuable channel to reach valuable customers and raise brand awareness.</p>

		<div class="description">
			<h5>The Good</h5>
			<p><strong>High quality, expert answers</strong> from industry leaders</p>
			<p><strong>Builds brand awareness for businesses</strong> as executives gain following</p>
			<p><strong>Increases traffic for businesses</strong> through referral links</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="main_body left_col"></div>
	<div class="main_body right_col">
		<p>However, we also saw mounting discontent from our readers who are starting to distrust Quora because they feel deceived by promotional answers </p>

	<div class="main_body promotional_content bad">

		<div class="description">
			<h5>The Bad</h5>
			<p><strong>Decreases trust with readers</strong> when for profit intent isn’t declared upfront</p>
			<p><strong>Low quality and spammy</strong> when answers are link filled and don't sincerely answer the question</p>

		<p><strong>How might we amplify Quora's distribution network's value for businesses without degrading the reading experience for our readers?</strong></p>
		<h4>Promotional Content as Paid Feature</h4>
		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>To reduce the amount of low quality, spammy promotional material on Quora, we decided that <strong>all promotional content must be tied to an account that this paying for a business subscription</strong>.</p>
		<p>In addition, I <strong>redesigned promotional content to be more transparent in the UI</strong> to set user expectations and rebuild trust.</p>

		<h4>Leveraging Voices of Individuals and Brands</h4>
		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>People have always come to Quora to get expert answers to their questions — that's why we focus so much on real names, credentials, and social signals.</p>
		<p>A unique advantage of Quora is that there are a lot of high profile executives answering questions about their company and product using their real names and credentials. By putting a human expert to the brand, it humanizes the interaction and makes it feel more authentic and we felt that it was important to preserve this magic and differentiator for our business services.</p>

		<p>Through user research, we also found that at many companies, business profiles are often ran by a team of marketers who rely on the strength of the brand that users already know and trust. Therefore, our goal was to <strong>design a system that allows businesses to leverage the voices of individual and brands.</strong></p>

		<p>In order to enable writers to write from both the voice of their brand and themselves, we setup an account structure where there is an <strong>overarching business profile featuring seats</strong> — where Individuals in these seats can write from their own voice for their business, or write from the voice of the brand.</p>
		<figure>

			<figcaption>Authors in seats can both write <em>for</em> the brand and <em>as</em> the brand</figcaption>

		<h4>Writing for Your Business</h4>
		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>To write for a business from your own voice, the writer can select the business profile they want to write for in the answer composer.</p>

		<p>This is an alternative UI I considered which features a more discoverable inline toggle. However, it was important to tie together authorship, credentials, and writing for a business profile so that authors can form an accurate mental model of how all 3 concepts are related to the business profile account structure. The dropdown does a much better job at relating the 3, and was ultimately chosen as the final design.</p>

		<h4>Writing as Your Brand</h4>
		<div class="squiggle"></div>

		<h4>Cutomizable Answer Actions</h4>
		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>Thanks to data and web tracking technologies, one advantage of online advertising is the ability to clearly quantify the return on ad spend. Most businesses and advertisers on Quora fall into this category where they have a target cost per action or cost per lead they need  to fulfill in order to justify their investment in Quora. Therefore, <strong>it's extremely important to allow businesses to drive users to take a measurable action they care about</strong>&gt; — usually in the form of visiting an external site, or filling in a lead generation form.</p>
		<p>One feature I designed for promotional answers is a customizable action, where the business can customize its behaviour to the action they care about.</p>
