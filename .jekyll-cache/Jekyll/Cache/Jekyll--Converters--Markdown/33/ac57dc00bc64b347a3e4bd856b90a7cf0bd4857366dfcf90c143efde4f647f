		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>Towards the end of 2019, the monetization team at Quora focused on exploring what a new stream of revenue outside of ads might look like. We decided to pursue <strong>a paid subscription to a suite of business oriented tools that would allow businesses to grow by leveraging their presence on Quora</strong>
		</p>
		<h4>Promotional content on Quora</h4>
		<div class="squiggle"></div>
		<p>Businesses like <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Jason-M.-Lemkin" target="_">SaaStr</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Gabriel-Weinberg" target="_">DuckDuckGo</a> have found enormous success growing their businesses by having their CEOs write expert answers to questions in their domain expertise— proving Quora's Q&amp;A format and distribution network as a valuable channel to reach valuable customers and raise brand awareness.</p>

			<div class="description">
				<h5>The Good</h5>
				<p><strong>High quality, expert answers</strong> from industry leaders</p>
				<p><strong>Builds brand awareness for businesses</strong> as executives gain following</p>
				<p><strong>Increases traffic for businesses</strong> through referral links</p>

	<div class="main_body right_col">
		<p>However, we also saw mounting discontent from our readers who are starting to distrust Quora because they feel deceived by promotional answers </p>

	<div class="main_body promotional_content">
		<div class="bad">
			<img src="/img/quora_3.png" />
			<div class="description">
				<h5>The Bad</h5>
				<p><strong>Decreases trust with readers</strong> when for profit intent isn’t declared upfront</p>
				<p><strong>Builds brand awareness for businesses</strong> as executives gain following</p>
				<p><strong>Low quality and spammy</strong> when answers are link filled and don't sincerely answer the question</p>

		<p><strong>How might we amplify Quora's distribution network's value for businesses without degrading the reading experience for our readers?</strong></p>
