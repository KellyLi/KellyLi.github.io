At Quora, I was one of the two designers that work on the Quora writing experience. Through user studies on writer motivation and writing habits, we made a series of product changes to construct the best space for Quora users to share their knowledge with the world.

  <h3>Here are some of the changes we made</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Gave users the option to provide the system with negative signals to improve personalized question ranking</li>
    <li>Provided motivation by making the community feel active and alive and showing users their personal progress</li>
    <li>Made it easier for users to access questions in topics that they are experts in</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Collecting signal</h3>

    <p>
    Quora delivers a ranked set of questions based on topics you follow, but following a topic doesn't necessarily mean that you are knowledgeable or interested in answering question about the topic. With the new Passing action, the system will learn your field of knowledge over time, delivering a more personalized list of questions.

<h3>Making it easier to find questions</h3>

We've also made it a lot easier for writers to access their favourite topics. Clicking on a topic in a customizable sidebar automatically loads all the questions in need of answers from that topic.
