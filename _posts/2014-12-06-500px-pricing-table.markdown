   At 500px, I worked on updating our Upgrade page, where the overall goal was to increase subscriptions. As a designer, that business goal translated into providing a way for the users to easily compare the features across the plans and helping them make a decision. The page should feel honest, features should be succinctly worded, and the most important information for the user- the price- should be prominently displayed.
