		<h3>Pickup Hiccup</h3>
		<p>Through both quantitative data and qualitative user research, we consistently find that the pickup is the most stressful point for both the rider and the driver. People often find it difficult to identify their driver's vehicle, espeically in dense, urban areas.</p>
		<h3>Light Up Your Ride</h3>
		<p>To make it easier for riders to identity their driver in the busy streets, the SPOTlights feature was created. Drivers' windshields are equiped with LED lights that can change colours, and a user can choose the colour for their ride as their vehicle is arriving. Users can also hold down the particular colour to light up their entire screen to wave to the driver.</p>
		<p>I designed and prototyped the user interface within the rider app for selecting and changing the colour of the lights. The Framer prototype here is interactive, try it out!<p>
		<p>The feature is being piloted in Seattle, and <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/02/sorry-your-driver-is-in-another-uber/' target='_blank'>here</a> is what TechCrunch had to say about it.</p>
