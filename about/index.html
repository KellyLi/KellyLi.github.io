				<p>As a product designer with an engineering background, I believe that we should never sacrifice beauty or function, and instead should be looking for where they intersect. From microinteractions and behaviour modelling, to speed and code quality-- the interactions between all system components determine the success of a product. It's important to be a holistic designer, and I've been challenging myself on every aspect from product design, technical development, to visual execution.</p>
				<p>I work in Photoshop, Illustrator, Vim, and Framer. Fluent in Python, HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
				<p>Currently looking for an internship for Fall 2016, say hi at <a href="mailto:kelly.li.chang@gmail.com?Subject=Internship">kelly.li.chang@gmail.com</a>.</p>
				<p>Find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kerri_Ri">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/klycl">Instagram</a>.</p>
