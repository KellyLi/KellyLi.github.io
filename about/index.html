			<div class='about_me'>
				<p>I was born in China, and grew up in Toronto straddling the line between a rapidly shifting Eastern culture and a Western education. As I navigated my way through highschool and university, I learned that the intersection between discinplines is where I thrive.</p>
				<p>As a product designer with an engineering background, I believe that we should never sacrifice beauty or function, and instead should be looking for where they intersect. From microinteractions and user behaviour modelling, to speed and code quality-- the interactions between all system components determine the success of a product. It's important to be a holistic designer, and I've been challenging myself on every aspect from product design, technical development, to visual execution.</p>
				<p>I work in Photoshop, Illustrator, Vim, and Framer. Fluent in Python, HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
